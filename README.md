# Optimal Control of a Quadrotor with Suspended Load

<p align="justify">
This project investigates optimal control strategies for a quadrotor equipped with a suspended load, a system characterized by nonlinear and highly coupled dynamics. The study focuses on three methods: Newton‚Äôs method for trajectory generation, Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) for trajectory tracking, and Model Predictive Control (MPC) for predictive constrained control.

Newton‚Äôs method is applied to compute optimal state-input trajectories between equilibrium points, exploiting second-order information for fast convergence. Both step-based and smooth reference trajectories are evaluated, with results showing that smooth references improve convergence speed and accuracy. Based on these trajectories, the system is linearized and an LQR controller is designed to provide robust tracking and disturbance rejection. Finally, an MPC framework is developed to handle system and input constraints while ensuring smooth control actions. Simulations demonstrate that MPC achieves superior tracking in the presence of disturbances, although with higher computational cost.

The comparative analysis highlights the complementary nature of these approaches: Newton‚Äôs method is effective for trajectory optimization, LQR ensures reliable real-time performance, and MPC provides flexibility under constraints. These findings contribute to the development of advanced control solutions relevant to applications in aerial robotics and autonomous systems.

## Task 0 ‚Äì Problem Setup
Begin with setting up the problem:
- In `Quadrotor.py`, you'll find the dynamics function, Jacobians **A** & **B**, and the parameters.

---

## Task 1 ‚Äì Trajectory Generation (I)
- To define a reference curve between two equilibrium points, open `Ref_Trajectory.py`.
- Initially, the equilibrium points are `(xp1, yp1) = (0, 0)` and `(xp2, yp2) = (1, 1)`. Feel free to choose other values.
- After setting the equilibrium points, proceed to `Newtons_Method.py` and run the code. 
- The default reference curve is a step function. The algorithm will find the optimal trajectory after a few iterations.
- **Outputs include:**
  - Optimal trajectory
  - Desired curve
  - Intermediate trajectories
  - Armijo descent direction plot
  - Cost and norm plots along iterations

---

## Task 2 ‚Äì Trajectory Generation (II)
- Generate a smooth state-input curve and perform trajectory generation (Task 1) on this new desired trajectory.
- After setting the equilibrium points, proceed to `Newtons_Method.py` and run the code. 
- In the main loop, `trajectory_type = "Step"`. Change it to `"Smooth"`.  
- The algorithm will find the optimal trajectory after a few iterations.
- Run the code to observe the results.

---

## Task 3 ‚Äì Trajectory Tracking via LQR
- This task uses the **LQR algorithm** for optimal feedback control to track the reference trajectory.
- Open `Traj_Tracking.py` and set the `perturbed_initial_state` under **Set the Initial Perturbed State**.
- The code outputs comparisons and animations showing trajectories **with and without LQR**.

---

## Task 4 ‚Äì Trajectory Tracking via MPC
- This task involves using an **MPC algorithm** for trajectory tracking.
- Open `main_MPC.py` and under **Set the Initial Perturbed State**, you can set or create your own `initial_state_perturbed`.
- To see how MPC behaves if perturbed **during tracking**, uncomment lines under:
  - *Add external disturbance III*
  - *Add external disturbance IV*
- Run the code to check:
  - System trajectory plots
  - Tracking error plots
  - Animations



Feel free to experiment and modify the parameters to explore different aspects of the control algorithms. Enjoy your journey into quadrotor control!
